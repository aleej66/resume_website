# Default Profile Image

This file serves as a placeholder for the default profile image.

To create a default profile image:

1. Create a simple image with your initials or a generic avatar
2. Save it as "default-profile.jpg" in this directory
3. Make sure it's a square image (1:1 aspect ratio)
4. Recommended size: 300x300 pixels

If no profile image is found, the website will display a placeholder or fallback to a generic avatar.

You can also use online services to generate avatar images:
- Gravatar (https://gravatar.com/)
- UI Avatars (https://ui-avatars.com/)
- DiceBear Avatars (https://avatars.dicebear.com/)

Example of generating an avatar with UI Avatars:
